## Project Objectives  

The **SugarPlush Online Service Platform (OSP)** is an e-commerce web application designed to give users a smooth and enjoyable online shopping experience buying plushies. The project was built in two major phases:  

- **Iteration I**: Focused on front-end development, making the site visually appealing and interactive using **HTML, JavaScript, and CSS**. This phase set up core features like item selection and a shopping cart with a drag-and-drop function.  
- **Iteration II**: Focused on back-end development, adding database integration and server-side functionality using **PHP and MySQL**. This phase introduced user authentication, secure payment processing, and admin tools for managing products and orders.  

### Key Features  

1. **Shopping System**  
   - Users can browse plushie products and **add them to their cart** with an easy-to-use drag-and-drop feature.  
   - The cart dynamically updates, letting users modify quantities or remove items before checkout.  

2. **Delivery Tracking**  
   - Integrated with **Google Maps API**, the platform shows users their **order delivery route** in real time.  
   - Users can track estimated arrival times and optimized routes for deliveries.  

3. **Payment Processing**  
   - Secure **card payments** allow customers to complete purchases easily when signing up.  
   - Users can use saved payment methods for faster checkout.  

4. **User Authentication & Account Management**  
   - Users can **sign up and log in** securely with their email and password.  
   - Personal accounts store **delivery addresses, payment details, and order history** for convenience.  

5. **Database Integration**  
   - A **MySQL database** stores user profiles, orders, products, and payment details.  
   - Data is retrieved and updated dynamically to keep the system running smoothly.  

6. **Admin Dashboard**  
   - Site admins have tools to **add, update, and delete products** in the store.
