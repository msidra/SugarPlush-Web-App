Logging in as Admin:
In order to be able to access DB Maintenance, signup with the email "4amaryam@gmail.com" (all other sign 
up information is up to you, it is only essential to use that specfic email). DB Maintainance will be found in 
the nav bar of index.html

Logging out: 
In order to log out, you must be signed in and on index.html(home page) an icon will appear which can be clicked 
on to show log out

Logging in as normal user: 
Normal users (any other email aside from 4amaryam@gmai.com) have access to everything expect for DB Maintainance, 
so it will not show on the nav bar when logged in.
